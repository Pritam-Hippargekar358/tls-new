Server Certificate - Private Key
$ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out server.key 2048

Request for a CSR
$ openssl req -new -sha256 -key server.key -out server.csr
	Country Name=PH
	State/Province=Laguna
	Locality=Filipino

	It will ask for the server's password; use the default one. It will also ask for a challenge password and an optional company name that you can leave blank.
	
Sign the Server Certificate
$ openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out server.pem -days 365 -sha256
	
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -in server.pem -out server.p12 -name server -nodes -inkey server.key

Create the Truststore
Import the CA Certificate into a PKCS#12 Truststore
server can rely on the CAâ€™s verification of clients.
using a CA is the standard practice for systems handling multiple clients.
While there may be scenarios where trusting individual certificates is necessary, such as in a one-client setup
$ keytool -import -file rootCA.pem -alias rootCA -keystore truststore.p12 -storetype PKCS12

	client-auth : NEED/WANT/NONE
NEED means that the server must verify the client certificate, while WANT also requires a client certificate, but it will maintain the connection if no verification is provided. When NONE is used, no client certificate is required.
